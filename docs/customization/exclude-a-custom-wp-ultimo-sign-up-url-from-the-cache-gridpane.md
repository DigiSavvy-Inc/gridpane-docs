# Exclude a Custom WP Ultimo Sign-Up URL from the Cache

 

2 min read 

If you‚Äôre using a custom sign up URL for your WP Ultimo website and it doesn‚Äôt end in ‚Äú.php‚Äù, then you may need to exclude that page from your websites cache. If you‚Äôre using our server caching options, below is a walk through on how to do this, and below is an example of what happens if the sign up page is cached:

## Step 1: Log into your server as root

Use your favorite SSH client and connect to your server IP as root. If you‚Äôre not sure how to do this, please see the following articles to get started:

Generate your SSH Key:

Generate SSH Key on Mac

Generate SSH Key on Windows with Putty

Generate SSH Key on Windows with Windows Subsystem for Linux

Generate SSH Key on Windows with Windows CMD/PowerShell

Add your SSH Key to GridPane:

Add default SSH Keys

Add/Remove an SSH Key to/from an Active GridPane Server

Connect to your server:

Connect to a GridPane server by SSH as Root user.

## Step 2: Add your cache exclusion

If you‚Äôre using Redis¬†page caching, type:

```
nano /var/www/site.url/nginx/custom-skip-redis-cache-context.conf
```

The ‚Äúsite.url‚Äù is the real domain of your site.

If you‚Äôre using FastCGI¬†page caching, type:

```
nano /var/www/site.url/nginx/custom-skip-fcgi-cache-context.conf
```

The ‚Äúsite.url‚Äù is the real domain of your site. For our example ‚Äúwaas.monster‚Äù from the

Then copy the below information and paste inside your SSH client. On most machines this will be a right click with your mouse, not a CTRL + V.

```
if ($request_uri ~* "(/signup*)") {
 set $skip_cache 1;
 set $skip_reason "${skip_reason}-request_uri";
}
```

The top line should contain your sign up url. For example, if your sign up url was superwaas.com/signup, the above would work correctly. If it was ‚Äúsuperwaas.com/register‚Äù the top line would be:

```
if ($request_uri ~* "(/register*)") {
```

CTRL+O and then press Enter to save the file. You can then exit nano with CTRL+X.

## Step 3: Test your nginx (important)

You‚Äôll want to run an ‚Äúnginx -t‚Äù on the command line. This will test your configs, and if all is well, it will show the below message. If it shows any failures, or any message other than what is below, do NOT proceed to step 4:

```
root@servername:~# nginx -t
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
root@servername:~#
```

## Step 4: Reload nginx configuration

Remember, if you didn‚Äôt have a successful test above, do not proceed. Finally, reload your nginx config by running ‚Äúgp ngx reload‚Äù on the command line.

You‚Äôre now all set üôÇ
