# Developer Legacy

 

Our Developer plan includes all of the great features included in our Panel plan plus a massive amount of functionality that will save you time, save you money and help you grow your hosting/care plan business.

 

 

## Configure and Create Websites in Just a Few Clicks

 

GridPane allows you to configure all of the following when you create new websites so your preferred settings are all activated for you as your website is created:

## Configure Local and Remote Backups

 

Good backups are like insurance… if insurance covered everything, cost practically nothing, and always paid out. They are the single most cost effective investment in your online presence that you will ever make.

 

##### Fully Configurable

You choose how frequently to back things up, all the way up to every hour. Who can afford to lose an entire day worth of work or data? Not the kind of WordPress pros that we built this for.

##### Local and Remote Backups

Backup your websites hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly directly on your server and to any or all of our supported third-party providers we integrate with.

##### Encrypted and Deduplicated

Our backups are extremely space-efficient and secure.

## Advanced Staging Websites

 

GridPane staging allows you to test your WordPress plugin and theme updates on your staging website before updating your live website and test your code and other dev work before setting it live into production.

Our advanced staging features allow you to:

## Simple, Highly-Effective WordPress Security Made Easy

 

Fundamental WordPress security is built directly into the platform, and you can easily use options like forced routing and putting each website on its own system user to keep them isolated and secure.

 

 

#### A+ Grade SSL Certificates

We make provisioning A+ grade SSL certificates quick and simple. Use our Cloudflare/DNSME integrations to provision wildcard SSLs.

 

#### Secure wp-config.php

We store the wp-config.php file one level up from the htdocs directory to keep it hidden and protected.

 

#### Rate Limiting

Out of the box, we rate limit requests to wp-login.php and the admin-ajax endpoint, providing simple but highly effective brute force protection.

 

#### Force Routing

Avoid common exploits with forced routing so that your website can't be exploited to redirect your visitors elsewhere.

 

#### Website Isolation

Keep your individual websites isolated and secure by creating individual system users. This ensures that if one site was ever to be compromised, it cannot cross-infect any other website.

 

#### HTTP Security Headers

We implement security headers by default to ensure security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting and clickjacking are automatically prevented.

 

#### SFTP and SSH Only

We enforce secure server connections via SFTP and SSH only. No FTP, no exceptions.

 

#### Firewalls

New websites will always be provisioned on an up-to-date version of PHP – unless you go out of your way and manually make it otherwise.

 

#### Secure WordPress Users

Newly created websites have strong passwords by default. You also have the ability to set your own default username.

 

 

#### Disable XML-RPC in One-Click

XML RPC is an old, outdated, and insecure method of remotely posting to your WordPress website. If you’re not using it, you should disable it completely.

 

#### Block PHP Execution Outside WordPress Loop

We already block PHP execution from wp-content/uploads/* by default, and you can further dramatically increase your websites security by enabling this hardening measure.

 

#### Block Enumeration, Scraping, and More

Additional measures include disabling username enumeration, disabling emojis and RSS, hiding your WordPress version, and blocking trackbacks, OPML linking, upgrade.php, install.php, load-scripts concatenation, and comments.

 

## Advanced Git: Full and Hybrid Integrations

 

GridPane allows you to easily connect a Git repository to your websites and even auto-deploy on commit. We offer two different integration types, and you can even configure your own scripts to run at the server level and/or site level before deployment and the site/server level after deployment.

 

 

#### Full Git Integration

Our full integration is what most users will be familiar with, and with this WordPress core, plugins, and themes are all managed via Git. The entire codebase is immutable and so WordPress updates can only be made via Git deployments.

#### Hybrid Git Integration

Our hybrid integration is for those of you who only want to handle specific plugins and themes via Git. Unlike the full repo as described above, the hybrid repo is not immutable, so WordPress core and any other themes and plugins not set in your repo are handled the traditional way inside the WordPress dashboard.

## Snapshot Failover™

 

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1091'%20height='935'%20viewBox='0%200%201091%20935'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://gridpane.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GridPane-WordPress-Hosting-Servers.png) 

Snapshot Failover™ is a proprietary high-availability setup that allows you to clone all of the sites on one server over to another server and set a syncing schedule for as little as one hour.

Couple this with DNS failover (also included!), and you can ensure your websites stay up and running even if your provider has an outage that impacts an entire data center.

Snapshot Failover™ covers certain outages better than traditional failover setups and makes it simple to ensure a working clone of your most important websites is ready to go if your primary server ever experiences an outage.

 

 

 

## UpdateSafely™ Beta

 

UpdateSafely™ is our trademarked WordPress update system and is designed to take care of a big part of your WordPress maintenance routine so that you no longer have to.

UpdateSafely™ works by making a copy of your live site, running available WordPress updates (core, theme, and plugin), and then runs a sophisticated visual comparison. If everything goes smoothly, it will proceed to update your live site, completely taking over update management for you.
