## Step 1. Sign up for a Wasabi account

To get started head on over to https://wasabi.com/sign-up/ and create your account. At the time of writing it comes with a 30 day free trial. Be sure to set up your billing details before your free trial is up to prevent any loss of data.

On completing the sign up form you’ll receive an email inviting you to create an account.

You’ll be taken to a page to complete your sign up.

And you will then be logged into your new account.

 

## Step 2. Create Your Wasabi API Credentials

To create your credentials click through to the Access Keys page, and then click on the “Create New Access Key” button in the top right hand corner.

A modal will appear. Select “Root User” and then click on the Create button.

Your credentials will be created and displayed on the screen. You’ll need to either make a copy or download the CSV file as these will not be shown again.

 

## Step 3. Add your Wasabi API credentials to GridPane

Back in your GridPane account, click through to your settings page:

Here, click through to the Integrations page, click Backup Providers, and enter your API details in the Wasabi tab:
