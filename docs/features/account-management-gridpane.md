Support

To ensure that our team can help you as efficiently as possible, please provide as much relevant information as possible in your first message. This includes your logs, troubleshooting steps you’ve already taken

GridPane is self-managed hosting, not managed, and you will need to do your part in troubleshooting.

For Panel accounts (and for most general issues for other accounts), support starts in Community Forum and, if necessary, we’ll create a support ticket for you.

Our team is active in the forum all day every day.

Profile Settings

The first tab in the Settings page is your profile tab. Here you can change your account email address, account profile picture, and time zone.

The time zone is important as it will ensure your notifications display the correct timestamp for your location. Learn more here:

Teams

GridPane allows you to create teams to help you manage the websites that you host, and/or give your clients access to manage their own websites. This article breaks down how it works and the different options available to you.

Security

Inside Security in your Settings page, you can change your password and enable 2FA.

GridPane API

In your Settings page in GridPane API you can create your own personal access token and regenerate the GridPane API token.

The API is still beta and is being actively developed. This article provides an intro for getting started:

SSH Keys

Adding your SSH Keys to GridPane is quick and easy, and you can set default keys so that they’re automatically added to newly created servers (you’ll still have to push them to existing servers).

If you have trouble adding your SSH key, see this article for troubleshooting steps:

Integrations

Here you can add your API keys for the various services that we integrate with.

Cloud ProvidersDetails for cloud providers can be found in their provisioning docs:

DNS Providers

Backup Providers

SMTP Providers

More coming soon.

Default Server Build Defaults

The default server build settings are all self-explanatory. Here you can set how the following will automatically apply to newly created servers:

Learn more about these settings here:

Default WP Build Settings

 Default UpdateSafely Settings

UpdateSafely™ is our trademarked WordPress update system. This new 2.0 version (still currently in beta) has been recreated from the ground up and is designed to take care of a big part of your WordPress maintenance routine so that you no longer have to. Learn more here:

Slack Notifications

We highly recommend that you enable Slack notifications for your account, and this article will get you up and running:

Immutable Blueprints

Immutable Blueprints are specifically for our multitenancy feature. This currently has no public documentation and is only available at the Agency tier.

Bundles

GridPane Bundles let you preconfigure your GridPane WordPress site deployments with the Plugins and Themes installed that you most commonly used.

You can create many different types of Bundles to suite the different types of projects that you work on. This is our doc on getting started:

For themes and plugins that are not available on the WordPress repository, you can still use them with Bundles if you self-host these. Here’s how to do so with Dropbox and Google Drive:

Onboarding

Here you can view our onboarding videos directly in the application. These are also available here in this article:

More videos will come in the future.

Addons allows you to enable our GridPane 360 Preemptive Support service on your servers.

Preemptive Support allows you to manage enrolled servers.
