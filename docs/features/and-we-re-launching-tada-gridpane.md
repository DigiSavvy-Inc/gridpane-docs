# And… we’re launching. Tada.

 

1 min read

I’ve decided to take the Seth Godin route to “launching” a product or service… and not have a huge official launch.

I will instead focus on showing up today, February 1st, 2018, and every day from here on out.

It is my sincere goal that GridPane as tool, as resource, and as a company, will provide utterly absurd value to everyone that it touches. And that it will, in some small way, make a difference to this industry and to the larger WordPress community.

If we accomplish a fraction of my ambitions then this venture will be seen as a huge success. For myself this software, and the journey to build it, has already had a life-changing impact.

Kinda sounds like bullshit, I know. I get it. It’s just software.

But I can’t tell you the relief that washes over me when I get 30 rapid notifications on my cell, all in a matter of seconds, half of which are “Site Down!” messages… the other half of which are “Site Back Up” notifications.

Then I look at my kids and I look at my wife… and I smile. And dinner proceeds with all the regular levels of chaos, no additional work drama added.

Our team is small and the problems that we see in the “Managed WordPress” industry are vast. Possibly insurmountable.

But I don’t believe that these problems should exist. They aren’t “useful problems” to have.

So they will cease to exist, eventually, one way or another. Possibly by our hand but most assuredly they will not stand the test of time.

There will be much more to come.

We plan on showing up, day after day.

Until the only problems left are interesting ones.
