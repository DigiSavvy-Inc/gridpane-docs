# Command Line Fundamentals

 

 

## Introduction

 

Learning the basics of the Linux Command Line is far easier than most people realise, and a little knowledge will go a long way when it comes to making the most out of GridPane. Below is a step by step list of articles that will help you go from zero to comfortable in minimal time. It’s not in-depth training, but it will provide you with the knowledge and confidence to follow along with any articles within our knowledge base.

 

 

## Part 1. The Basics

 

The following two articles will provide you the basics for working on the command. You’ll learn some fundamental commands, see how it all looks when you use them, and get some essential familiarity with navigating around your servers.

Before you begin, you may want to create a server that’s purely for testing (start with Nginx). That way you can run any commands you wish to try and know that whatever you do you can’t cause any damage to your production sites and servers.

## Part 2. Practical Exercises

 

The following articles will give you some practical experience. Create a test website to follow along.

Exercise 1: For the first exercise you’ll follow along with the knowledge base article to set up WebP images to work with the Shortpixel plugin.

## Bonus: top and htop

 

The above articles cover all the basics, and hopefully at this point you feel comfortable following along with our knowledge base articles. For 99% of use cases, you only need to know these basic fundamentals.

As additional bonus, we also highly recommend getting familiar with the top and htop utilities. They are extremely useful for diagnosing issues in real time, and are important tool sfor everyone who works on the command line.
