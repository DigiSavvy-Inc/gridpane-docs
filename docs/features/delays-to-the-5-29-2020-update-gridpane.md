# Delays to the 5-29-2020 Update

 

1 min read

Due to a last minute hiccup with the newest update that we were going to push, we’re not going to push it.

So we’re going to do the following: update you all on Monday as to what is coming… and then push it within 24 to 48 hours of that.

Lots and lots and LOTS of little things.

Nothing that should require any changes to your workflow. Other than perhaps less unexpected WTF moments.

Teams updates, more people on the remote backups, complete UpdateSafely overhaul and the beta access for that, tons of little bug fixes.

Too much to cover. So no changes right now.

There shouldn’t be anything upsetting once we do push those next week. I realize that merely by saying the previous line a handful of people will get pissed off and will self-immolate.

Complete breakdown, including, wait for it… *changelog updates* !!! to follow first of next week.

No video, obviously. I’m not gonna make a video about not making an update.

Books you should read…
