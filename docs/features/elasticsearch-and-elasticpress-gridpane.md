# Elasticsearch and ElasticPress

 

7 min read 

## Introduction

Elasticsearch is a feature available to all our users on the developer plan. This is a great feature for anyone who has a site that has a lot of information, for example, a large news website or blog, a knowledgebase, or a large e-commerce store.

### Table of Contents

If you‚Äôre coming from a managed hosting provider, there‚Äôs a good chance you can save a lot of money by making the switch over to GridPane. You can run it on as many websites as you need, and there‚Äôs no per website fee attached.

One thing to note before you get started is that Elasticsearch can be resource-intensive.

 

## What is Elasticseach?

Elasticsearch is an open-source search engine. Its scope goes far beyond WordPress and can be used for things like analytics, spotting data trends, machine learning, and more.https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-intro.html

For our purposes with WordPress, it‚Äôs an extremely fast and accurate search engine that replaces the default WordPress search function. You can use Elasticsearch and the ElasticPress plugin to index all of your website‚Äôs content, and then provide fast and accurate search results from this index faster than MySQL can run the same search.

You can use Elasticsearch to decrease search time, improve result accuracy, and create a customized search experience for your visitors.

The ElasticPress plugin has a great breakdown of all of the features it offers and it‚Äôs well worth a read:https://wordpress.org/plugins/elasticpress/

 

## Using Elasticsearch on GridPane

To get started with Elasticsearch, you first need to reach out to our support so we can install it for you on your server/s. We‚Äôll have a toggle for this feature in the future, but for now please submit a support ticket with your server name and IP address and we‚Äôll take care of it for you.

Once it‚Äôs been installed on your server you‚Äôll then need to install and configure the ElasticPress plugin on your website/s.

 

 

### Information: DigitalOcean and Elasticsearch

In the past, Elasticsearch has had issues with servers on DigitalOcean, returning 451 errors during the installation process and causing it to fail. This no longer appears to be the case, but should it happen this is beyond our control and you may need to use a different provider.

## Configuring ElasticPress

### Step 1. Install the plugin

The plugin is available from the WordPress repo ‚Äì simply search for ElasticPress, then install and activate it like any regular plugin.

### Step 2. Enter the¬†Elasticsearch Host URL

Inside your settings page, we need to enter the host URL.

The Elasticpress.io tab is for their paid integration. We need the ‚ÄúThird Party/Self Hosted‚Äù tab, and then enter HTTP://localhost:9200¬†in the¬†Elasticsearch Host URL box. Then click Save.

### Step 3. Index your content

Now we‚Äôve connected the plugin to the server we can index your website‚Äôs content. You should automatically be taken to the page where you can begin the process. Depending on the size of your database this can take some time.

Once complete, you may wish to check the ‚ÄúIndex Health‚Äù page, and hit the refresh button in the top right-hand corner.

### Step 4. Customize your search features

The ElasticPress plugin has a lot of customizable features that you can take advantage of to make your website‚Äôs search experience even better for your target audience.

Each section has a ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù dropdown with information about what each feature does.

The plugin also has two additional settings pages. One is for managing search fields and ‚Äúweighting‚Äù. Weighting means prioritizing specific results, for example, giving weight to page titles or excerpts, etc when a user performs a search.

The other page is for creating custom search results.

## ElasticPress Autosuggest

ElasticPress 2.4 introduced autosuggest, which is a very cool feature that will automatically make suggestions for your existing content when users begin typing in your search fields. Many of the world‚Äôs largest websites use this functionality.

### Using Autosuggest on GridPane

This is available on both Nginx and OpenLiteSpeed servers, but the setup and WordPress plugin settings are different for both.

To get started you‚Äôll need to connect to your server ‚Äì please see the following to get started:

 

Step 1.¬†Generate your SSH Key

Step 2.¬†Add your SSH Key to GridPane¬†(also see¬†Add default SSH Keys)

Step 3.¬†Connect to your server by SSH as Root user¬†(we like and use¬†Termius)

 

## Enabling ElasticPress Autosuggest on Nginx

Inside Dashboard > ElasticPress > Features you‚Äôll find the autosuggest feature.

Here you‚Äôll see the following notice:

You aren‚Äôt using ElasticPress.io so we can‚Äôt be sure your host is properly secured. Autosuggest requires a publicly accessible endpoint, which can expose private content and allow data modification if improperly configured.

### Community Contribution

The following was provided to us by one of the GridPane community on how they implemented this on their website. You can also learn more here:

 

### Step 1. Create an Nginx Config

On your server, run the following command to create your ElasticPress auto-search config (switching out site.url for your URL):

```
nano /var/www/site.url/nginx/elasticautosearch-main-context.conf
```

This is the community code snippet, modified from the original snippet from 10up:

 

```
location /ep-autosuggest {
  # only allow POST requests
  limit_except POST {
    deny all;
  }

  # Perform our request
  rewrite ^/ep-autosuggest(.*) $1/_search break;
  proxy_set_header Host $host;

  # Use the URL of the server here
  proxy_pass http://localhost:9200;
  return 403;
}
```

Now save the file with CTRL+O followed by¬†Enter. Exit nano with¬†CTRL+X.

### Step 2. Check and Reload Nginx

Check the Nginx configuration file with:

```
nginx -t
```

If no errors are returned, reload Nginx with:

```
gp ngx reload
```

 

### Step 3. Enable Autosuggest Inside of WordPress

Back inside your website, add ‚Äúep-autosuggest‚Äù as your Endpoint URL, and set the status to Enabled.

Note the message that says ‚ÄúEnabling this feature will require re-indexing your content.‚Äú

When you‚Äôre ready, click¬†Save.

 

## Enabling ElasticPress Autosuggest on OpenLiteSpeed (OLS)

Inside Dashboard > ElasticPress > Features you‚Äôll find the autosuggest feature.

Here you‚Äôll see the following notice:

You aren‚Äôt using ElasticPress.io so we can‚Äôt be sure your host is properly secured. Autosuggest requires a publicly accessible endpoint, which can expose private content and allow data modification if improperly configured.

Below we‚Äôll look at how to safely configure this on OpenLiteSpeed.

 

### Step 1. Edit Your Website‚Äôs blocks.conf

On OpenLiteSpeed we‚Äôve created the blocks.conf include where you can add custom rule blocks. The contents of this file are added directly to your website‚Äôs vhconf once it‚Äôs regenerated.

Edit this file with:

```
nano /var/www/site.url/ols/blocks.conf
```

Add the following to your file, but edit line 10 and replace¬†siteurl with your URL, removing the period. For example, for GridPane.com this would be: context /gridpanecom-post-1/_search {.

 

```
extprocessor elastic {
  type                    proxy
  address                 localhost:9200
  maxConns                300
  initTimeout             60
  retryTimeout            60
  respBuffer              1
}

context /siteurl-post-1/_search {
  type                    proxy
  handler                 elastic
  addDefaultCharset       off
}
```

Now save the file with CTRL+O followed by¬†Enter. Exit nano with¬†CTRL+X.

### Step 2. Add a rewrite rule

Next, we need to add a rewrite rule. Rule the following command, replacing site.url with your URL:

```
nano /var/www/site.url/ols/rewrites.conf
```

Add the following, again replacing ‚Äúsiteurl‚Äù with your URL without the period:

```
RewriteRule /siteurl-post-1(.*) http://elastic/$1 [P]
```

For example:

```
RewriteRule /gridpanecom-post-1(.*) http://elastic/$1 [P]
```

Now save the file with CTRL+O followed by¬†Enter. Exit nano with¬†CTRL+X.

 

### Step 3. Regenerate Your Websites vhconf

Next, we need to regenerate your vhconf to add your updates with the following (replace¬†site.url with your URL):

```
gpols site¬†site.url
```

We‚Äôre now done with the server-side work.

 

### Step 4. Configure the plugin settings

In order for Autosuggest to work, the Endpoint URL box has to match the context path in step 1 but this time using the full URL, including the protocol:

https://site.url/siteurl-post-1/_search

Here I‚Äôve used input[type=‚Äùsearch‚Äù] as the Autosuggest selector since it‚Äôs the core WordPress search box.

If for some reason it‚Äôs not working then it‚Äôs likely that you need to update the autosuggest selector.
