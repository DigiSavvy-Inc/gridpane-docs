If you’re using the very popular Germanized for WooCommerce on your store, you may encounter a “too many redirects” error in the WP backend after updating the plugin.

The fix for this is to use the self help tools to run a full cache clear on your website. You can quickly and easily do this inside your GridPane account on the tools page as shown in the image below:

Alternatively, on your server you can run:

```
gpfix cache site.url
```

For example:

```
gpfix cache gridpane.com
```

### Next Step: Clear Cookies (if applicable)

If you’re still experiencing a redirect, even after clearing the cache inside the self-help tools, then this is likely to be cookie related. Please try clearing your cookies, or check your website in incognito mode.
