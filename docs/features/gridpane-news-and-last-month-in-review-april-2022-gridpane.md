## GridPane Core: Our New Free Forever Plan

On April 1st we released the new GridPane Core plan, and it is no joke.

Core is a completely reimagined look at what was previously the Free Forever plan. It’s back, it’s packed with more features, it has higher site limits, and it’s free, for everyone, forever.

Our CEO Patrick published a blog post with all the details, including why we’re investing our time and energy into a plan we’re not charging for. You can read all about it here:

## Deep Dive: Cloudflare Firewall Rules for Securing WordPress Websites

Cloudflare offers an excellent (and easy) way to lock down and secure various endpoints on your WordPress websites, as well as offering a simple one-click DDOS protection measure should you ever come under a serious attack.

In April we published a deep dive on Cloudflare’s Firewall and making use of these rules on their free plan

Cloudlfare allows you to quickly and easily lock down endpoints, prevent spam, block bad bots, and country/continent-based blocking.

## Client Portal Updates

The Client Portal received some major updates in April. This includes:

The new Client Portal role editor allows you to  build site & user-based permissions and assign multiple roles to a single client/team member. You can fine tune exactly what users have what permissions. Here’s a quick Loom from Tobi: PanelPress – New Role Editor

We’ve also released numerous bug fixes based on everyone’s beta testing feedback.

Development continues on!

### Client Portal Questions

 

What is the Client Portal (AKA PanelPress) for?

Here’s a quote from Patrick, our CEO from a discussion in the Community Forum (join here):

The goal here is to give your staff and your clients a more simplified interface, without all of the various bells and whistles which are in the standard “nuclear reactor” UI. And at this stage we’re looking for feedback and input around what everyone would like to see in the context of a more simplified client facing portal. Which would allow you to effectively become your own Kinsta.

Many of the features that you see here will inevitably make it into the core UI. But as we went down rabbit hole it become clear that having an entirely simplified and completely separate UI was FAR easier than trying to make the full featured UI simpler.

Because there’s simply too many dials. You can’t make a nuclear reactor simple. And you shouldn’t try. Somewhere along the line of simplification and abstraction you’ll miss something which will be crucial.

So we started at square one, with effectively the minimum viable dose. And now we will add to that, based on feedback, only what is absolutely essential. And we will give you granular controls over who can see/touch… whatever.

You absolutely will be able to add infinitely more users to this. But we have no established price point for that as of yet. We’ll be making those decisions based on feedback from this very group.

For now we want to work on polish and getting to something that we can generally agree is feature complete. And then it will become generally available and people will be able to add on packs of 10/25/50 whatever clients/sites.

So the long term idea is that you and senior members of your team can go way into the woods and configure everything down to the MB and PHP worker, inside of the nuclear reactor dashboard. But on the client side, and for your less experienced staff and outsourcers, they get electricity and a toaster.

 

How can I get access?

Right now the Client Portal is in closed beta. As soon as it’s in open beta we’ll let you know.

### Change the Default SSO User

By default, our SSO feature uses the WordPress user with the lowest ID number inside the wp_users database table. It starts with WordPress user #1, and if that doesn’t exist, tries #2, and so on. If you would like to change this to another user, it’s a quick simple process. This article details how to update it:
