## Introduction

Hey WordPress Warriors! August saw lots of behind-the-scenes work take place, much of which lays the groundwork for future updates. There were also some improvements and fixes which can be seen on our changelog. Below is the regular rundown.

### Table of Contents

 

## PanelPress.io: Client Portal Update

A few updates were pushed last month that include:

The bulk of the Client Portal work is still on building V2 and moving from Bubble to a completely custom-built implementation.

 

## Redis Object Caching Plugin Update (Nginx Only)

For the last couple of years, we’ve used a fork of the Till Kruss Redis Object Cache plugin due to some compatibility issues. These have since been resolved, and in August we switched back to Till’s original plugin that can be found in the WordPress repo. This is the object caching plugin that will now be installed on newly created websites moving forward.

Any existing sites that use our fork will continue to work, but we’ve published a knowledge base article detailing a few different methods to easily update sites from our fork to the original.
