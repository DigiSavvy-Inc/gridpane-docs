## PanelPress.io: The Client Portal Open Beta Release

The Client Portal was released into open beta on May 22nd. If you’re on Developer you can sign up here: https://panelpress.io/

You’ll need beta features active on your account in order to get access to the GridPane API – you can request via a quick support ticket.

This is a HUGE release for us and one that we hope will have a significant impact for you and your business. You can learn more about PanelPress.io in this announcement blog post we published on May 23rd:

A couple of notable updates for May include:

 

## Newly Published Knowledge Base Articles

We published 6 new articles in May. Four of these are detailed guides on various topics, plus two shorter guides on IPv6 and a quick fix solution. The two shorter guides are:

1. GridPane and IPv6

2. Why Does My Website “Download” Instead of Load? Double Gzip and How to Fix it

Below is a rundown of the 4 more indepth guides.

 

### 3. Mitigating DoS and DDoS Attacks On Your WordPress Websites

DoS and DDoS attacks are rare in the grand scheme of things. There are a lot of sites on the platform, and we have a great suite of security tools, so many likely go unnoticed, or at least never come to our attention on support. Occasionally they do though, and this guide details how to quickly diagnose and put a stop to them (where possible).

### 4. How to Migrate a WordPress Website with WP-CLI and rsync

There are many ways to migrate a WordPress website, but the most efficient is arguably with WP-CLI and a program like rsync.

This is especially true for large websites where plugins often have trouble, and sometimes can’t be used because there’s not enough disk space to create the backup.

This kind of migration is done over the command line and is far more straightforward than most people realize. In this article, we take a look at how to migrate a website to GridPane:

### 5. Scaling Your WaaS Network: Advice for WP Ultimo, and Multisite vs Multitenancy

WaaS networks are a popular revenue channel for more WordPress professionals and agencies. They allow for a relatively hands-off, predictable monthly revenue stream where clients handle most of their own website building using premade templates.

For now, WP-Ultimo is really the only plugin available for a multisite WaaS. We have an integration with Ultimo that will add mapped domains to the domains tab inside your website’s customizer, and you can use our AutoSSL feature to automatically attempt to provision an SSL for these domains as they’re added.

Ultimo is a great plugin for market validation and proving that you have a business that you can grow. To build a truly scalable WordPress SaaS though, multitenancy is the only safe, secure, and limitation-free solution. Learn more here:

### 6. An Introduction to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies are HTTP response headers that are used to increase the security of a website. A request for a resource (for example a font file, JS, CSS, etc) made by a source outside of your domain name (the origin) is known as a cross-origin request. You can create a CORS policy to allow and manage cross-origin requests for any of your websites on an as needed basis.

At first glance CORS may seem similar to a Content Security Policy (CSP), however, their functions are very different. Learn more here:

## Knowledge Base Article Updates

In addition to the 6 new articles above, in May we updated 21 existing articles:

The Diagnose and Fix Common Issues page has also been updated.
