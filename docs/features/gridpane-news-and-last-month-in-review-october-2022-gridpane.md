## Introduction

Hey WordPress Warriors! October saw the relaunch of our affiliate program along with numerous updates, fixes, and improvements. We’ll take a look at all the highlights below.

## Affiliate Program Launch

In October, we officially relaunched our affiliate program. We believe this is one of, if not the most, competitive hosting affiliate programs on the market, with up to $1500 commissions and monthly recurring commissions for Panel and Developer plan referrals.

Full details and a link to sign up can be found here: The GridPane Affiliate Program

To be eligible to sign up, you will need to be on a paid GridPane plan and have made your first payment once the free trial period has ended. A verification check will automatically take place during the sign-up process, so there’s no need to wait on us to manually approve your account.

Additional resources to help you promote GridPane will roll out over time, and we are certainly open to any suggestions you may have. Also, if you have a large audience to which you would like to promote GridPane, we can work with you directly in various ways.

Finally, if you have any questions, please post them in our community forum, and we’ll get back to you there ASAP.

 

## Changelog

October saw some fixes moving the Git beta and UpdateSafely™ beta forward. UpdateSafely™ also saw a couple of additional improvements added so that WordPress Core database updates and WooCommerce database updates also run, if applicable.

We’ve also added new functionality to OpenLiteSpeed for managing access and error logs, along with new GP-CLI to make this process simple. Below you’ll find the accompanying knowledge base article with all the details.

You can check out the fixes and improvements on our roadmap here: https://roadmap.gridpane.com/f/changelog/

 

## Newly Published Knowledge Base Articles

We published 5 new articles in October. Number 3 below covers the new OpenLiteSpeed access and error log rotation and retention customization options.

 

### 1. Checks When Migrating/Cloning From One Server to Another

This article came about from a thread in the Facebook group.

There will come a time when you need to move your websites from one server to another. This may be to give a specific site more resources, such as moving a growing WooCommerce store to its own individual server or upgrading from an older version of Ubuntu to a newer version.

Whatever the reason, this article outlines some of the checks that you may want to include in your own internal processes.

### 2. Provision a Microsoft Azure Server Using Our Custom Server Option

Azure is not typically a service that we would recommend for hosting WordPress, but there are circumstances where it may be the only provider that you’re able to use for a specific project, or you may have Azure credits you would like to make use of.

If that’s the case, then this guide will walk you through the process of creating and configuring an Azure VM and connecting it to GridPane.

### 3. How to Configure OpenLiteSpeed (OLS) Log Settings and Retention

The GridPane OpenLiteSpeed (OLS) stack offers the ability to adjust how your website error and access logs are configured on the server. This includes the size they’re allowed to grow to before being rotated, and how long they are retained for. This article details how to configure these settings.

### 4. GridPane GitHub Action

This is NOT needed or necessary to understand or use our Git integration.

However, for those of you who know what it is and how to use it, here’s a GitHub action created by one of our Developers.

### 5. Website Redirecting When Cloudflare’s Proxy Active (Orange Clouds ON)

If you ever come across a website redirect that happens when you turn the Cloudflare proxy on (orange clouds active), and then the redirect stops once you turn it off (grey clouds), then your domain was likely previously registered with a Cloudflare SaaS partner.

Technically, what’s happening is not actually a redirect, it’s Cloudflare pointing the domain to the A record of the previous SaaS partner.

## Knowledge Base Updates

In addition to the 5 new articles above, the following knowledge base articles have all received tweaks and updates.

As noted in our previous newsletters, there’s more info to come on Ioncube loaders and setting the PHP CLI version. However, this only applies if you have manually installed them.

 

## That’s a Wrap!

Thanks for reading. We’ll continue to keep you posted in the weekly newsletter. Have a great November everyone!
