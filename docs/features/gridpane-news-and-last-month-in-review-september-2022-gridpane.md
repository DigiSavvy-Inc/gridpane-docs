## Introduction

Hey WordPress Warriors! September was a busy month finished with our big Git update. We’ll take a look at all the highlights below.

## We’ve Taken a Strategic Investment from Automattic

Just before WCUS on September 7th, we announced that we have completed a seed round of funding, including a significant strategic investment from Automattic, the parent company of WordPress.com, WooCommerce, WordPress VIP, and Jetpack.

If you haven’t already, I highly recommend that you read the full announcement blog post. This also has a Q&A section that will answer any further questions you may have.

## Git is Now in Open Beta

We’re very pleased to announce that our Git integration is now in Open Beta. This is a significant release, and we would like to encourage everyone who has the time to test it. If you come across any bugs, please let us know via a support ticket so that we can confirm and fix them, and move Git into full production ASAP.

As with all beta features, these are NOT considered production-ready, and there is no critical/urgent support or support guarantees.

### Beta Feature Activation

To access the Git beta, you will need a Developer account with beta features enabled. If you already have beta features enabled, you will see the new Git page inside your account in the main menu.

If you don’t see the Git page, you can request beta activation by submitting a support ticket.

### Git Documentation

Our Git feature is fully documented, and we also have a beginner’s guide to help you get started. Documentation can be viewed here.

 

## Affiliate Program Update

Our long-awaited affiliate program has been rebuilt, but its planned September launch was delayed. This additional time is well worth the wait, and will serve both ourselves and our affiliates far better now and in the future.

The affiliate commissions are highly competitive, and we’ll be launching ASAP.

 

## WP Cloud and GridPane

GridPane is now the only host outside of Automattic who have an integration with wp.cloud – Automattic’s scalable, highly available, extremely fast WordPress cloud platform.

In September we made a start on our WP Cloud integration with GridPane. This is a highly custom environment, so its availability and integration will differ significantly from our other server provider integrations.

If you have a serious workload, such as a big and busy WooCommerce store, high concurrency LMS and/or Buddyboss, etc, and you have a budget to match, then WP Cloud may be an ideal solution for you.

 

## Changelog

The changelog has been updated. The major releases are detailed above, and you can check out the other fixes and improvements on our roadmap here:

September was mainly focused on getting Git ready for its Open Beta release, but numerous other updates and fixes were also released, including a couple for UpdateSafely.

 

## Newly Published Knowledge Base Articles

We published 3 new articles in September, including our BunnyCDN article, to finish up our CDN series. We’ve also published a detailed guide on what size servers to choose and why. If you have any questions about choosing servers for your business, this is the guide for you.

To go along with this article, we also published one new learning path.

### Servers and Performance

The move to your own servers also brings a learning curve that will make you a better WordPress professional but does require a little time to learn the ropes. Much of that learning curve is covered in these articles, and here you’ll learn the fundamentals of choosing the right servers and gaining stellar WordPress performance.
