## Managed WP Cloud Hosting

Best fit: Use WP Cloud for websites where peace of mind is paramount.

WP Cloud includes far superior server specs to most other managed WordPress providers, as well as real-time backups to a secondary data center that your site will automatically be served from if your primary server ever goes offline for any reason, and much more. You can learn more about our fully managed WP Cloud hosting here:

## GridPane Self-Managed Hosting

Best fit: GridPane self-managed is for everyone who works with WordPress professionally, and everyone should at least have our free Core account.

Many WordPress pros believes that “self-managed” hosting is too complicated for them or that you need prior experience working on the command line or even being a professional sysadmin to use our platform.

This is simply not the case. In fact, if your websites aren’t full of codebase errors and you stick to our recommendations for number of sites per server, your servers will simply run themselves.

GridPane also offers approximately 380 knowledge base articles, and you and your team can dramatically improve your skills and become fully capable of both offering AND selling an exceptional managed WordPress hosting service to your clients.
