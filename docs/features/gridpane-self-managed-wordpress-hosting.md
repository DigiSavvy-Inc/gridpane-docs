## Why Choose GridPane?

 

Your hosting shouldn’t hold your business back—it should propel you forward. We believe hosting should empower growth, not saddle you with arbitrary restrictions or hidden fees. That’s why we’ve helped thousands of websites migrate away from traditional WordPress hosts to solutions that save money, supercharge performance, enhance security, and backed by a support team that solves problems instead of selling upgrades.

Whether you’re running a giant WooCommerce store, offering hosting as a WordPress agency/developer/designer, or your simply seeking a reliable hosting partner for your business, we can help.

 

The Problem

 

## Traditional Managed Hosting Is An Expensive, Restrictive Black Box

 

At almost every managed WordPress host your resources are restricted and hidden from you, the servers you share are oversold, and the answer to every performance question is to upgrade your plan.

 

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='800'%20height='500'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20500'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://gridpane.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/wordpress-hosting-black-box.jpg) 

Everything is hidden – specs, resources, logs, how many sites you’re sharing a server with… etc.

 

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='800'%20height='500'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20500'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://gridpane.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/hosting-economies-of-scale.png) 

Economies of scale almost all go to the hosting company, not you.

 

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='800'%20height='500'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20500'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://gridpane.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/hostingaddons.jpg) 

Addons like Object Caching, backups, page views, etc, are obscenely overpriced.

 

## There is a better way.
