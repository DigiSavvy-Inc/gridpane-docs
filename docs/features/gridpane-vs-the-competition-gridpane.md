## GridPane vs The Competition

 

If you’re looking to find out whether GridPane is the right fit for your business then you’re in the right place. Below you’ll find thorough comparisons on how we compare to best-known names in the WordPress hosting industry, and who our perfect clients are.

We’re not for everyone, but we may be the perfect fit for you.

 

 

### Introduction

 

We include a comparison for each of the best-known names in the Managed WordPress Hosting space below, but there are a few problems common to almost all managed WordPress hosts that GridPane handily solves…

 

Managed WordPress hosts typically sell rigid plans that put strict restrictions on “views” per month, PHP workers, and so on. These plans may be fine for the average low-traffic brochure-style WordPress site, but it means you have no control to optimize your hosting environment for use cases such as WooCommerce, LMS systems, or WaaS networks.

 

Because you don’t have the ability to customize your servers, the only way to get the resources needed for your more resource-intensive websites is to upgrade to higher plans that are considerably more expensive. Support is also restricted by this rigid approach and so instead of guidance on how to solve stack related problems, you’ll be sold a higher plan. Even if their support is top-notch, their hands are tied, and upselling you is the only solution.

 

Almost all Managed WordPress Hosts come with one stack option and restrictive plugin bans. This is often fine for many use cases, but it means you’re handcuffed on the way you run your caching, handle your backups, and more. This is a common complaint and is problematic to many developers and agencies offering their own hosting and care plan services.

 

There’s no cost-effective way for a WordPress agency to run their own hosting or care plan service for a steady stream of monthly recurring. Managed WordPress Hosting is a premium level hosting service and it is charged as such.

 

### Enter GridPane

 

GridPane solves all of these problems and includes many features that aren’t available at any Managed WordPress Host. We offer WordPress agencies and developers the ability to create enterprise-capable servers, choose from multiple stack options (Nginx, OpenLiteSpeed, MariaDB, and Percona 8), multiple Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), PHP customization options (including PHP workers), a comprehensive backup system, and a whole lot more. Also, because you provision your own servers, even a small $10/month VPS can handle a TON of traffic and there are no arbitrary page view limits.

If you’re a WordPress agency or developer that’s serious about growing your own hosting/care plan service, GridPane is purpose-built to serve your needs!

### GridPane vs Flywheel

 

Flywheel is a “division” of WP Engine, although with slightly better plans for the same money – at least in our opinion. They’re a popular choice with WordPress pros when they first move from shared to managed hosting.
