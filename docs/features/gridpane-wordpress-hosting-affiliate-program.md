## Q&A

 

What are the affiliate commissions?

The affiliate commissions are $100 for a Panel account referral, $500 for a Developer Plus account referral, and up to $1500 for an Agency account referral.

Panel and Developer accounts, also receive a 10% recurring commission each month while the referred account remains active.

Agency plans are a 1-time payout only. We offer a big initial finders fee, but due to the high-touch nature of these accounts, the 10% recurring fee monthly commission is not available for these referrals.

When will I get paid?

You will get paid 40 days after your referred lead purchases a GridPane product. That timeframe covers our 30 days’ money-back guarantee and the ten days we need for the transaction. The 40 days period starts after the free trial period.

How will I get paid?

We pay out commissions via PayPal. The PayPal address will default to the email address associated with your Affiliate account. You can change the PayPal address in your affiliate dashboard at affiliates.gridpane.com.

For super affiliate relationships, we may be able to arrange other payment methods.

Do I need a new account if I also had one in the previous system?

Unfortunately, importing from our previous affiliate system has a few issues, so you will need to sign up again and create a new referral link.

How are conversions tracked?

After signing up, your affiliate account dashboard will display your affiliate URL. This URL defaults to a token generated based on your name, but inside your account, you’ll also be able to change this if you prefer.

If a lead visits your GridPane URL, we set a cookie for 60 days. The referral will appear in your affiliate dashboard as a click, and if the lead signs up for a GridPane plan, your referral count will increase.

###### The most recent click will be awarded the conversion

The most recent referral click will always be awarded a sign-up conversation.

For example, if someone referred the same lead as you two weeks earlier, but then today, this same lead signed up after clicking your link, you would receive this conversion, not the previous referrer.

###### Link to any page

We track every page on GridPane.com.

How long do tracking cookies last?

Cookies are set for 60 days.

 How do I check my referral statistics?

To view your referral statistics, simply log into your affiliate account at affiliates.gridpane.com. Here you will see your affiliate link click count, the number of referral sign-ups, paid customer conversions (after the free trial period), and your earnings summary.

You will find details on your referrals as soon as they click on your link and land on GridPane.com – every single page is tracked, and click and sign-up statistics are instant.

Paid conversions will display once your referrals have made their first payments.

Why is the Agency plan also not recurring?

Due to the high-touch nature of these accounts, the 10% recurring fee monthly commission is not available for Agency referrals. Instead, to our knowledge, it is the industry’s highest commission.

Also, there is a significant investment needed on our part when onboarding new Agency accounts, and there’s also a significant discount available if the client decides to pay annually. All of this would need to be tracked manually, and that’s not viable at this time.
