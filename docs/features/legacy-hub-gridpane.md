# Legacy Hub

 

Now that our Panel, Developer, and Developer Plus plans are no longer available to new clients, this hub has been created to keep you up-to-speed on your plans features and functionality. Below you’ll find a link to each plans product page, and directly below that, you’ll find a feature comparison table and a Q&A section.
