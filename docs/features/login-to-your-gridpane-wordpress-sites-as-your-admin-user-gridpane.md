To log in to a GridPane WordPress site as your Admin User is no different than logging in to any other WordPress site.

## Step 1. Get your WordPress Admin User Credentials.

GridPane allows you to set a Default WordPress Admin User that will be automatically used when creating any new WordPress sites. It’s very simple to set up and we have an easy to follow guide here.

If you are using this feature then your Default Admin User credentials can easily be viewed in your GridPane User Settings.

In this case you can find your site’s WP Admin User’s credentials in your site log. We have an easy to follow guide that shows you how to view your site log here.

Visit your WordPress site login page

Now you have your Admin User login credentials, simply visit your GridPane WordPress site by appending /wp-admin  to the site domain, like so:

http://your-site-domain.com/wp-admin

or if you are using an SSL

https://your-site-comain.com/wp-admin

Enter your Admin User Credentials and then click log in.
