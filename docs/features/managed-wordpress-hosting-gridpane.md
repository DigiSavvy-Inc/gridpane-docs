## FAQ

 

Is Vultr the only server provider available?

We’re happy to work with any reputable server provider if you have specific needs. The pricing on this page reflects hosting your websites on Vultr servers, so we would need to discuss your requirements before providing you with a quotation.

Is transactional email included?

At this time transactional email is not included. You will need to use a provider such as SendGrid, Postmark, Amazon SES, etc. We can make recommendations and assist in the set up.

What is 360 pre-emptive support?

Preemptive Support “360” is OUR version of what we believe true managed WordPress should actually look like. It allows us to offer site-specific support in a holistic, sustainable way.

360 allows our team to see your site and server problems BEFORE they become critical.

Our systems will monitor your websites, servers, and notifications, and should we identify any issues, we’ll automatically create a support ticket for our team.

If your websites go down in the middle of the night, we’ll know about it and begin working to resolve it so you can sleep easy knowing that we have your most important websites covered.
