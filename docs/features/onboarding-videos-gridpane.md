# Onboarding Videos

 

1 min read 

Built in to the GridPane UI is five onboarding videos, you can get to them by clicking your name in the top right corner, clicking “Your Settings” and then going to “Onboarding” in the left side bar, towards the bottom.

If for some reason, you can’t view these videos, or would like to download them, you can view them on Vimeo. Here are the links:
