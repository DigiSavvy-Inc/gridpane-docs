Pro Features

 

## Staging & Backups

 

Our excellent backup system offers both local and remote backup options, from hourly to monthly, and with no restrictions on how long they remain available to you for. The industry average of 4 weeks doesn’t cut it for many websites, so rest assured that PeakFreq will not force this same restriction on you.

Our staging system offers an extremely reliable way to test your updates, develop directly on your server, and smoothly move your websites from live to staging or staging to live anytime.

 

24/7 Team and Built-in Monitoring Systems

Our systems are highly reliable, allowing you to focus on growing your business instead of attending to support-related dumpster fires.

## Host WordPress on the highest performance Vultr servers

 

Transparent PHP worker, CPU, RAM, and disk specs. Server resources are shown upfront instead of hidden from you.

 

 

#### Ultrafast CPU

Vultr's High-Frequency and High-Performance servers are well known for ultrafast page loads.

 

#### High Performance RAM

Fast RAM can make all the difference when it comes to dynamic workloads like WooCommerce, LMS, and BuddyBoss.

 

#### Massive SSD Storage

Cloud servers come with far more SSD storage than regular hosting plans, so you can host more websites for less, without sacrificing performance.

#### How much should you deposit?

PeakFreq will likely save you a significant amount on your current monthly spend, and the service will be approximately 30% cheaper than Cloudways. That said, we’d recommend depositing the same amount as your current monthly hosting spend. For example, if you’re spending $300/month at Cloudways, we’d recommend depositing $300.

### Optional: Whiteglove Migrations

 

100 white Glove Server migrations are available with this discount and with a full 100% credit towards your future PeakFreq fees.

Here’s a specific example: You purchase three server migrations with a 30% discount, and you pay a total of $525. Under the terms of this current special, you get three full server white glove migrations (including site and tenancy audits) with *unlimited sites* migrated, AND you get a full $525 worth of credits applied to your future PeakFreq spending.
