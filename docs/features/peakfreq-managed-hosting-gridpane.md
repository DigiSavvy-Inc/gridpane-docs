Our support team may require action to be taken on your part. This may include – but is not limited to – freeing up disk space, reducing the number of sites on a server (due to support tickets being created due to too few resources on your server), or moving sites to a bigger server.

 

### PeakFreq Support Tickets

### Server Monitoring

As these servers are part of our managed service, our systems are hooked into them, monitoring for alerts and resource usage that could result in serious issues (for example, disk space filling up to 100%), or site performance plummeting.

These notifications are channeled directly to our support team so that we can help resolve issues before they become critical.

Monitoring includes server resources, service health, server load, and file systems issues. It does not include individual site monitoring.

 

## PeakFreq Billing Information
