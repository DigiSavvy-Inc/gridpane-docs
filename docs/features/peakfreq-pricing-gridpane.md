#### How much should you deposit?

PeakFreq will likely save you a significant amount on your current monthly spend, and the service will be approximately 30% cheaper than Cloudways. That said, we’d recommend depositing the same amount as your current monthly hosting spend. For example, if you’re spending $300/month at Cloudways, we’d recommend depositing $300.

## FAQ

 

Are there any site limits? How many sites can I host on one server?

As everyone’s websites are different, with different traffic, plugins, themes, admin usage, etc, it’s not possible to give you an accurate answer.

However, a good rule of thumb for fully cached brochure-type websites is 7-10 sites per 1GB of RAM. This means you can host roughly 15-20 websites on a 2GB RAM server, and 30-40 on a 4GB RAM server.

###### PeakFreq + Core Site Limits

When using PeakFreq with our free Core plan, there is a hard 5 production websites + 5 staging websites per 1GB RAM. This means you can host 1o production websites on a 2GB RAM server.

What is the difference between PeakFreq and creating servers directly at Vultr?

The primary differences between PeakFreq managed hosting and our Self-Managed plans are:

That all said, the primary reason you should add new PeakFreq servers is to access the fastest CPU cores available AND get proactive server monitoring and management for one low fee.

About PeakFreq Managed Hosting

Where are my sites hosted with PeakFreq?

PeakFreq is a combination of GridPane software and Vultr hardware. You can choose to create servers at any of Vultr’s many data centers around the world.

You can view an up-to-date list of data center locations here:

Is email included?

Email is a specialized service and it’s not included in any of our plans. This means that your clients may need to use a service like Google Workspace, Outlook or Zoho for their business email.

For transactional website email, you will need to add an email service to your websites. We have an integration with SendGrid, or you can attach services such as AWS SES, Postmark, Mailgun etc, using a plugin like Fluent SMTP.

Why are some server sizes greyed out or missing?

If you’re trying to select a server but it’s greyed out in the dropdown menu, you may not have enough credit deposited in your account to cover the cost of this server.

If the server size you’re after is missing, this means that Vultr is currently out of stock in this particular configuration at the selected data center. Usually, stock becomes available again pretty quickly, so you will likely be able to get this server size in the very near future.

Are there limits on traffic or visitors?

The only limits you have on traffic are the ones imposed by the bandwidth limits at Vultr. This is orders of magnitude higher than most managed hosts offer.

We never restrict or throttle your visitors on any of our plans, and so long as your servers stay at or below their established bandwidth limits, you’ll never have to pay overages for too much traffic. All of our plans can support many hundreds of thousands, and potentially even even millions of monthly visitors.

Do you provide root access to my servers?

Yes, you will have full root access to our PeakFreq servers.

If I have a PeakFreq server can I open support tickets for non-PeakFreq servers on Core/Panel?

Support tickets will only be available for your PeakFreq servers.

Is the staging feature included?

Yes, you will be able to use our standard staging features.

Is the backup system included and do I pay for remote storage separately?

Our backup system is included on PeakFreq servers. This includes local backups that take place on the server and remote backups that are stored at a remote storage provider.

The the remote storage itself is not included and you need to bring your own AWS-S3 or Backblaze B2 account.

Do server snapshots take place at Vultr?

Yes, snapshots are turned on and included in our plan pricing. However, these should only be used in worst case scenarios.

Do I have to manage security and OS updates myself?

We handle automated security updates of all the installed services, and any stack updates when appropriate.

We do not recommend you updating outside of this, and on these simple VPS type plans we never upgrade OS in place. You can use our cloning features to move to a new server with a new OS. Learn more here:
