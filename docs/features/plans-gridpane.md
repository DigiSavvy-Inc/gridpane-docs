How do I access more features?

In the near future, all plans will be able to purchase features as addons within their account. You’ll be able to pick and choose the features that you need, and pay as you go.

How can I sign up for the Panel and Developer Plus plans?

These plans are no longer available for sign up. However, in the near future you will be able to access all GridPane features via addons.

Where can learn more about Core, PeakFreq, and Bespoke plans?

You can learn more about each plan and their features on the following pages:

How many sites can I host on one server?

As everyone’s websites are different, with different traffic, plugins, themes, admin usage, etc, this is impossible to answer.

However, a good rule of thumb if we’re talking solely about fully cached brochure websites is 7-10 sites per 1GB of RAM. This means you can host roughly 15-20 websites on a 2GB RAM server, and 30-40 on a 4GB RAM server.

Are there limits on traffic or visitors?

The only limits you have on traffic are the ones imposed by the bandwidth limits of your chosen provider.

We never restrict or throttle your visitors and so long as your accounts with your hosting providers stay at or below their established bandwidth limits, you’ll never have to pay overages for too much traffic. All of our default providers have plans that can support many hundreds of thousands, even millions of monthly visitors, for as little as $5/month.
