#### GridPane Policies

 

Unlike most managed WordPress hosts, we at GridPane don’t put restrictions on what you can and can’t do with your servers. You have full root access, and we place no restrictions on things like what plugins you can and can’t install.

That said, the policies below are strict in terms of what we can support, and they are put in place for good reason.
