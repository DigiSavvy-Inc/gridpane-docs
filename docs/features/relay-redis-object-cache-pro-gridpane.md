Object Cache Pro is the upgrade to the free Redis object cache plugin. When combined with Relay, this is extremely powerful for WooCommerce, LMS sites, BuddyBoss, or any dynamic sites where users are actively logged in/managing the backend.

 

 

## Upgrade Your Website Performance

 

 

#### Relay Included

GridPane is one of the few hosting services where Relay is available.

 

#### Massive Performance Boost

Relay is a Redis™ client like PhpRedis and Predis, except two orders of magnitude faster. Object Cache Pro is built to allow your websites to take advantage of Relay (along with an improved admin experience).

 

#### Significant Reduction of MySQL Memory Usage

Your servers want to move your databases into memory. Relay can offer a significant reduction in your MySQL memory footprint, meaning more sites per server, and/or preventing the need to upscale.

 

#### Built in Database Cache Priming

Cache priming is the process of preloading or warming up the cache to ensure that the most frequently accessed content is readily available for visitors, enhancing site performance.

 

#### Debugging & Logging

The opt-in logging and detailed error reporting makes troubleshooting becomes a breeze. You can even integrate your own PSR-3 logger for added flexibility.

 

#### Rigourous, Continual Testing

Each alteration to the codebase undergoes rigorous testing against all supported PHP versions and various Redis configurations, comprising single instances and clusters ranging from version 4.0 to 7.0, boasting over 1500 test cases to ensure complete coverage.

#### WooCommerce Optimized
