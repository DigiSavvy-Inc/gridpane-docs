# Running GridPane on a Local Virtual Machine (VM) Demo

### Info

Special thanks to Hubert Nguyen for putting this demo together. This walkthrough was originally a part of our live HostingMBA event.

 

The above video offers a walkthrough for setting up GridPane with VirtualBox. The same steps should work with any virtual machine (VM), but please note that this kind of setup is beyond the scope of our support (however, posting within the Facebook group may be worth a try if you have any trouble setting things up).

### Important

GridPane requires a BRAND NEW KVM virtualized VPS or bare metal server with only standard Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (recommended) or 20.04 LTS image installed. 
Once initial provisioning is complete at the provider, log in to your server via console or SSH and run our provisioning command as ROOT.
Please do not use servers with less than 1GB of RAM as these cannot be supported and don't offer adequate resources for both the server stack and your websites.
Please do not use servers that have less than 30GB disk space.
GridPane does not support ARM servers.
