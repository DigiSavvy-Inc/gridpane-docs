# WordPress Security Step by Step

 

 

## Part 1. Theory

 

The goal of this learning path is to give you a clear path forward for securing all the websites that you host on your GridPane provisioned servers. Before you begin locking down your sites though, here are two articles that will help provide an overview of the bigger WordPress security picture.

The first is focused on the threats and how GridPane’s security options help guard you against them. The second is a real world case study on locking down two websites where security was a very high priority.

## Part 2. GridPane Security Overview

 

Security is at the heart of everything we do here at GridPane, and we have some very cool features that you can use to secure each and every one of your websites. The two articles below offer an overview of what GridPane secures “out of the box”, and then the options that you can configure on a per website basis.

## Part 3. Securing Your Websites

 

At this point we’ve taken a look at the theory and the options GridPane offers for securing your websites. Now let’s use them to start locking your sites down.

Below we’ll take a look at the 7G WAF (we also offer ModSecurity as well, but we generally recommend using that only for enterprise type sites), Fail2Ban, and our server level WordPress hardening options.

Congratulations! If you’ve implemented a WAF, WPFail2Ban, and our WordPress hardening options then you have locked your websites down tight.
