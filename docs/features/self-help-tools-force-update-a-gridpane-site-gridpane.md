GridPane will perform a series of checks, backups, and tests before attempting to update themes, plugins, and WordPress Core. Anything out of date will be updated and old versions removed.

Depending on the size of your site and quantity of updates needed, the time to complete a forced update varies. Check the Event Output Viewer to see all updates and the completion confirmation message.
