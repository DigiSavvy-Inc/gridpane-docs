# Snapshot Failover – High availability for the masses

 

1 min read

The entire Atlanta datacenter went down. And stayed down. For hours. Days in fact.

Dallas too, and Newark, out west – seemingly everywhere, all at once.

That was Christmas Day 2015 and the beginning of one of the most sustained and concerted Distributed Denial of Service attacks in the history of the Internet. It was an attack directed at one of my infrastructure providers, Linode.

And it blew up every single one of my clients’ sites up, all at the same time.

And there wasn’t a damn thing I could do about it. I was not OK with that feeling.

But that was a long time ago and LOT has changed since then. It all makes for a pretty decent story, one I’ll save for another time.

Suffice it to say that it all ends well and that conclusion forms one of the opening chapters in an entirely new story…
