# The June 1st Update…

 

2 min read… which we’re pushing out late on June 2nd.

This is late. I’m not gonna talk about why in THIS thread. But I will talk about the bigger picture soon.

For now, y’all deserve an update and here it is:

1.) It’s not gonna be quite what you wanted because the transcription of my video failed.

2.) I have very little time because I’m dealing with bigger picture things right now and this isn’t even THE update… it’s an update about what is coming with the update.

3.) By the time that many of you are consuming this, the REAL update may already be done.

But I’m gonna do this anyway.

So, there’s a video below and here is what it is about, in no particular order:

A.) Some great books… Measure What Matters, Managing Oneself, How To Get to $10M in ARR and Beyond… all gold!

B.) UpdateSafely Version 2(thousand).0 has landed. Details in the video. If you want to get in on it without listening to me drone on you can do so here IF YOU HAVE A DEVELOPER ACCOUNT: https://forms.gle/toS3EDyCFrq6mFvt5

C.) We need the users of our groups to GIVE. We have way too many TAKERS. ADD some shit. Leave the place better than you found it.

D.) We launched Apollo. We kicked all kinds of ass. Details here: https://reviewsignal.com/blog/enterprise-wordpress-hosting-performance-benchmarks-2020/

E.) I swear a lot. More than I’m supposed to. I’m going to continue to do so. Because this guy said I could: https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/865-be-who-you-are-and-say-what-you-feel-because

“Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind.”

― Bernard M. Baruch

F.) TONS AND TONS AND TONS OF TONS OF TEAMS UPDATES!?!?!

I’ve probably missed a bunch of things.

We’ll clean this up after the fact.

And… video:
