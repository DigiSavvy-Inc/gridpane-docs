## Step 2. Locate your Default WP Admin Settings

## Step 3. Update your Default WP Admin Settings (Optional)

To update your Default WP Admin Settings, click the blue pencil edit icon.

Here you can update your default username and email address for new WordPress websites. You also have the option to update all existing websites

Update your default settings in the pop-up Edit WP Admin Settings modal box and click Update. We recommend that you use the autogenerate password setting for best security.

You can also update all of your existing sites with this default user by checking the update all box – use wisely as this has the potential to update every website that you host.

More on how to locate autogenerated passwords in step 4 below.

 

## Step 4. Deploy GridPane WordPress site

If you’ve autogenerated your password/s, you can find them by checking the site log. Next to your new WordPress site, click the log icon to open up the log:

Here you’ll see your username and new password as highlight below:

 

## Step 5. Login to WordPress with your default WP-Admin User

Once you have deployed your site and your DNS records have resolving, you can visit it at your chosen domain and visit the login page as with any other WordPress site.

Or, you can access the website over a local redirect before you set your DNS live by following this article:

### Login

Head to your website /wp-admin page. For example:

http://your-chosen-domain.com/wp-admin

or

https://your-chosen-domain.com/wp-admin

Enter your WP Admin User credentials and click Log in.

### Future WordPress Websites

From now on, you can easily add your default WordPress Admin User automatically to every website that you create, or create a brand new one directly (plus up to 5 additional users).
