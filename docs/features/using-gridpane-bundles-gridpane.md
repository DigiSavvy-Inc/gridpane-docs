GridPane Bundles let you preconfigure your GridPane WordPress site deployments with the Plugins and Themes installed that you most commonly used.

You can create many different types of Bundles to suite the different types of projects that you work on.

## Step 1. Go to Your GridPane Settings

Login to your GridPane account and click the Your Settings menu item in the dropdown menu accessible by clicking on your username and icon.

## Step 2. Add a New Bundle

### Locate Bundles

Locate and click Bundles in the horizontal settings navigation to open the Bundles settings panel.

### Add a New Bundle

Enter the name for your Bundle in the Name input field and click Create.

Your Bundle will now appear in a panel underneath the Add New Bundle Panel. Click on your Bundles name to begin configuring it.

Your Bundles Panel will open and you will see two sub panels, one for Themes and another for Plugins, each with a button to add plugins and themes to the Bundle.

## Step 3. Configure your Bundle

### Add Themes to your Bundle

Click the button to add a theme.

A Popup modal will appear and provide you an input field to add a WordPress repository theme slug.
