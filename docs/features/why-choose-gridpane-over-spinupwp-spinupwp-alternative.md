## Why Choose GridPane Over SpinupWP?

 

SpinupWP is a WordPress hosting control panel created by Delicious Brains. Delicious Brains have a great team and they’ve made some great WordPress products. Interestingly, they don’t include ourselves on their comparison table even though we were the first in the space (though they do run ads for “GridPane”), so if you’re looking to understand the differences between GridPane and SpinupWP and decide who is the better choice for your business, you’re in the right place.

TLDR Summary

 

 

 

### Key Similarities

 

GridPane have an API integration with DigitalOcean, Vultr, Linode, AWS Lightsail, UpCloud, and you can use our custom VPS option to provision servers at essentially any quality VPS provider that you wish to use (including Google Cloud Compute, AWS EC2, Hetzner, and OVH).

SpinupWP have one integration with DigitalOcean, and you can also create servers at any provider you wish with their custom option.

You choose and control your infrastructure, and you can use each of our software and UI to manage your websites and servers.

 

With the exception of Pagely, pretty much every “managed” WordPress host charges based on “views” or extra PHP workers. This is due to the rigid way in which these platforms operate. Charging based on these metrics often leaves users with no choice other than to upgrade to a higher plan. The PHP worker restriction in particular can be highly problematic for eCommerce and LMS websites.

Neither GridPane or SpinupWP charge based on these types of metrics. You have a VPS or dedicated server, and these can handle what they can handle – no restrictions.

That all said, SpinupWP only includes 10 websites, and they charge extra for additional websites. This is by no means unreasonable, but it is a somewhat arbitrary restriction.

 

 

 

### Key Differences

 

The main difference between GridPane and SpinupWP is the markets we serve. SpinupWP are a WordPress focused cPanel alternative geared more towards SysAdmins who need a few small servers, and are looking to save time and gain performance over a regular shared hosting service.

GridPane is a comprehensive WordPress hosting solution with the backing of engineers on support 24/7. Our platform is built for serious WordPress agencies and developers who are looking to grow their WordPress business and provide high-end hosting services and/or website care plans for their clients for a premium price.

 

Need access to support for any kind of time-sensitive issue? SpinupWP is not for you.

GridPane has engineers on support 24/7, and our team literally solve WordPress specific issues and nothing else. One of the main reasons WordPress agencies switch to GridPane is due to the high level of support that our team offers. If you plan on growing a team to help you manage all your hosting clients, we’re the perfect partner for your business.

 

The team at Delicious Brains have built some great products, but they aren’t dedicated solely to building the best WordPress hosting solution available on the planet.

GridPane is pushing the boundaries of what WordPress hosting looks like. We were the first-ever hosting control panel dedicated to WordPress, and we’re now so much more. We’re now the first to offer both Nginx and OpenLiteSpeed servers, and Percona 8 or MariaDB database options. We’ll soon be launching one of, if not the most comprehensive backup solution available anywhere, and we have multiple WAF integrations, DNS integrations (including Cloudflare), UpdateSafely 2.0, and more.

We’re focused on building the absolute best WordPress hosting solution in the world.

 

SpinupWP comes with far fewer features than GridPane, and very limited access to support. As such their base plans are cheaper than our plans at GridPane.

That said, while SpinupWP doesn’t limit the number of servers you can create, there is a limit on the number of websites (10), and from there they have a $9 per 10 website’s model. This pricing is very reasonable, but GridPane has no such limitations.

GridPane’s pricing model is straightforward. We have plans that are designed to help you at different levels of your hosting venture’s journey. As you add more sites and servers to your account, the more you’ll benefit from the higher-tier plans.

 

SpinupWP runs an Nginx stack that’s far more performant than regular shared hosting. On regular, non-complex, low-traffic sites, you may not notice much of a difference in performance between SpinupWP and GridPane. At scale though, there’s no information about how SpinupWP performs, so we can’t provide a fair comparison.

That said, we’ll happily put any of our server stack options up against ANY WordPress hosting stack in the world, any day of the week. In fact, in 2020 we did just that and threw our hat in the ring for Review Signal‘s annual performance testing, and we came out with top-tier honors in the top-of-the-pyramid enterprise category. To summarise those findings, GridPane’s stack competes with the very highest-priced WordPress hosting plans in the world and will handle websites at scale at any level. One of our core goals as a platform is to help our clients create enterprise-capable servers.

GridPane is also the only platform to offer multiple stack options. With our developer accounts, you have the ability to customize your server stack with either Nginx or OpenLiteSpeed, and MariaDB or Percona for MySQL 8. Our out-of-the-box defaults are ideal for most WordPress websites, but you can then further customize them to meet your website’s specific needs. Need to tweak your PHP workers for a WooCommerce or LMS website? No problem at all, you can do it right in your dashboard.

### Which Service Is Right For You?

 

SpinupWP is a good solution for those who need a few sites hosted on a fast stack, and minimal support. If you’re a developer looking for a budget, WordPress focused cPanel alternative, and support is of no concern to you, SpinupWP could save you a few bucks per month vs using GridPane.

If you’re a WordPress agency or developer and you’re looking to grow your monthly revenue from your hosting offering, GridPane exists to serve your needs. We’re purpose-built for serious WordPress agencies and developers who are looking to grow their WordPress business and provide high-end hosting services and/or website care plans for their clients for a premium price.
