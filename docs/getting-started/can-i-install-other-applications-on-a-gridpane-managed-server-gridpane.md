### TL;DR

We don't recommend it. Yes, you technically can, however it may void our ability to provide support for this server and any WordPress sites hosted on it. If you must host these on GridPane, please use a separate server where no other WordPress websites are hosted.

## GridPane is Built for WordPress

GridPane has been created with one goal: to create the ultimate Cloud/VPS hosting management platform for serious WordPress development. To that end, and almost to the exclusion of everything else, we are focused squarely on WordPress.

Your GridPane servers run an Nginx or OpenLiteSpeed stack that has been built from the ground up to make your WordPress websites fast, secure, and able to handle world-beating amounts of traffic.

 

## Can You Host Non-WordPress Websites?

We’re aware that our stack could be used to host many other PHP-based applications, static websites, and much more. With some terminal work and some updated configuration files, you could install many other different applications on your server.

So you may be asking, can I install any other applications on my GridPane servers?

The answer is quite simple…

You could, but we do not recommend it and would like to discourage you from doing so.

 

## Your Servers and Support

Firstly, let us reiterate that you absolutely could. It is your server. With GridPane, you own the server; our platform’s job is to help you use that server to host and manage incredibly fast and responsive WordPress-based sites and web applications.

So, with that being said, we also need to say something else… if you do choose to install any other non-WordPress-based sites on your GridPane server, then the following applies:

We want to keep our eyes on the ball, our focus undiluted, and our support on point. To this end, we actively discourage the installation of other software on your GridPane servers. If you must do so, please make sure you do not host any of your WordPress websites on those servers.

 

## Installing Non-WordPress Websites/Applications

Having read our warnings above, if you would still like to use a GridPane provisioned server to host some of your non-WordPress websites, here’s a guide that may be helpful:
