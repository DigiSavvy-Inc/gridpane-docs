Migrating Your first Website to GridPane

Our KB article here will walk you through how to migrate a website over with zero downtime – we highly recommend giving this one a read and it will link to all of our main articles that focus on migration:

How to Migrate to GridPane with Zero Downtime

You can access your websites directly without needing DNS records using a local redirect to access the page. This is a super handy tool for developing and migrating your websites and is probably the easiest way to go about things for your first migration. The KB article below will walk you through how to set this up:

How can I edit my local hosts file to redirect URLs

Many clients and our own team members will the local host file open inside a text editor window so they can just jump right into it whenever needed.

One potential pitfall to be aware of here with this method is that if HTTPS is being forced within the website, it will need an SSL certificate after you’ve migrated it in, but if that’s not the case you should be able to access it without any issues.

Migrations are usually smooth sailing, but should you find any issues (or want to see what some common issues are), we have these thoroughly documented here and most are quick and easy to fix up/avoid:

Getting Started with DNS

If you’re new to managing your own DNS, don’t worry, this is really simple once you get the basics down, and it’s also an important part of taking control over your own hosting. These two articles will walk you through the basics:

Setting DNS Records

DNS Management and CNAMEs

We also have a direct integration with Cloudflare and DNS Made Easy that are well worth your consideration and Cloudflare is an absolutely free and fantastic service:

Provisioning SSL Certificates

SSL certificates are just 1 click away! Depending on whether you are using our DNS API integrations with either DNS Made Easy or Cloudflare, you may need DNS records to be in place.

This KB section details everything related to getting started with SSL certificates:

Provisioning SSL Certificates

Let’s Encrypt needs to verify that your domain is a real website. If you are not using an DNS API method they require that your DNS records are live, and this article is for you:

If you are using our DNSME or Cloudflare integration, this article is for you:

Provisioning an SSL for a domain using DNS API Domain verification

Staging websites are super easy to use with GridPane – you can toggle them on and off as needed, and pushing from staging to live, or vice versa is just a few clicks in almost all cases. Learn all about staging websites and how they work with GridPane here:
